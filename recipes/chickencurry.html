    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This is also one of the meals that I have made myself lazily while living alone. This is pretty simple yet very healthy and scrumptious.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Coconut milk</li>
        <li>Onions and garlic</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>
        <li>Chinese seasoning powder mix</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken.</li>
        <li>Chop the onions and garlic into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat up the frying pan and pour in cooking oil. When the oil is hot, put in the onion pieces.</li>
        <li>This is an important step as you will have to stir the onion pieces continuously on low heat.</li>
        <li>When the onion pieces turn golden, put in the chopped garlic pieces.</li>
        <li>When the garlic smell comes out, put in seasoned chicken and stir for about 5 minutes.</li></lli>
        <li>Pour in the coconut milk and leave it on for some time. Add water if needed.</li>
        <li>Put in the seasoning powder mix and when the meat is soft, turn off the heat, put chopped coriander onto the curry and we have a lovely meal!</li>
    </ol>
